# How much food does the birds coming to my window eat?


Birds coming every day to my window, there are beautiful, funny and interesting. I put fruit all days and I wanted to register the fruit weigh in order to obtain how much food does the birds coming to my window eat.

In the last five months I have feed to the birds with a total 24212 g fruit in my window, which their distribution can be show in the follow pie chart:

Birds have been eaten in five months 17524 g plantain, 3931 g banana, 1660 g papaya and 1097 g orange.

Orange is the most expensive fruit I put in my window, fortunately, birds don't like it much 😅.  

Papaya is the cheapest fruit, and birds love it but is a source of disorder and residues in my window 😱 and, my neighbors' windows 🙈(I live in the fifth floor).  

Banana and Plantain are similar in cost, and are their favorite fruit. However, in my neighboorhood is most common to find good ripe plantains and their can be storage for more time than bananas, so I decide plantain is the best option for my neighbors' birds. 🍌🍌🍌
